checkURL --> check HTML at url, and compare against previous version
             if changed, notify all clients "watching" that URL
             stretch goal: use If-Modified-Since so we don't have to compare each time
changedHTML --> implement function to do our "diff", should be referenced in checkURL
.start and stop clicks --> when stop is clicked, nuke websocket connection
                           when start is clicked, start up websocket connection again
client side "update" --> when client is notified of update, reload url and stick it in
                         the iframe
styling --> make it look pretty
strech goal: analytics
    server side --> maintain counter of number of users watching each url
                    when new client connects, increment counter,
                    emit "userCount" event to all clients (for that url)
                    when client disconnects, decrement counter,
                    emit "userCount" even to all clients (for that url)
    client side --> on "userCount" event , update userCount variable
                    d3, every 5 seconds, redraw chart showing last 5 minutes of
                    number of users (userCount) watching the URL they're watching
